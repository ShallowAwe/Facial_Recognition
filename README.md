# üë§ Face Recognition Flutter App

This Flutter app performs **on-device face recognition** using a pre-trained **FaceNet model** (`facenet_mobilenet.tflite`). It lets users select two face images, detects faces using **Google ML Kit**, generates **embeddings**, and compares them to calculate how similar the faces are.

---

## üîç What It Does

- **Face Selection**: Users select two images from the gallery.
- **Face Detection**: Google ML Kit is used to detect and crop the main faces from each image.
- **Embedding Generation**: A lightweight `.tflite` version of the FaceNet model generates 128-dimensional embeddings for each detected face.
- **Similarity Calculation**: The app calculates **cosine similarity** between the two embeddings and gives a percentage score with a simple label like "Very Similar".

### Result Analysis

**Screenshot Analysis:**
- **Good Lighting**: All images show clear, well-lit faces which improve detection accuracy
- **Frontal Poses**: Faces are positioned frontally, optimal for the FaceNet model
- **High Similarity Score**: The result screen shows a high percentage match, indicating the faces are likely from the same person
- **Clean Detection**: Face cropping appears accurate with proper boundary detection

**Why High Similarity:**
- Similar facial structure and features
- Consistent lighting conditions
- Clear face visibility without obstructions
- Proper image quality for embedding generation

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Model not loading?**
- Ensure `facenet_mobilenet.tflite` is in the correct `assets/models/` folder
- Check `pubspec.yaml` includes the model in assets section
- Clean and rebuild the project: `flutter clean && flutter pub get`

**Face not detected?**
- Ensure good lighting and clear face visibility
- Try images with faces facing forward
- Check image resolution (minimum 160x160 recommended)
- Avoid heavily shadowed or blurry images

**Low similarity scores?**
- Ensure both images contain clear, well-lit faces
- Try images with similar angles and expressions
- Check if faces are properly cropped and centered
- Avoid images with extreme expressions or accessories

**App crashes on image selection?**
- Check permissions are granted for camera and storage
- Ensure device has sufficient memory
- Try with smaller image files

## üîÆ Future Possibilities

- Compare faces with a pre-defined dataset (face library)
- Real-time recognition with camera feed
- Face-based app login or attendance system
- Save and export embedding profiles
- Multiple face detection and comparison
- Integration with cloud-based face recognition APIs
- Batch processing of multiple images
